# 🔄 Networking Flows

This section explains **real-world step-by-step flows** of how networking works.

Instead of isolated concepts, these files show:

* How systems interact
* What happens behind the scenes
* How protocols connect together

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

* How internet works
* DNS resolution flow
* HTTP/HTTPS request flow
* TCP connection flow

---

## 🎯 Goal

Understand:

> "What actually happens when you use the internet"
# 🌍 How Internet Works (Step-by-Step)

When you type a website like **google.com**, this happens:

---

## 🔹 Step 1: DNS Resolution

* Domain name is converted into IP address

---

## 🔹 Step 2: TCP Connection

* Your system establishes a connection with server

---

## 🔹 Step 3: HTTP Request

* Browser sends request (GET /)

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Server Response

* Server sends HTML, CSS, JS

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Rendering

* Browser displays website

---

## 🧠 Key Insight

Internet is just:
👉 Client ↔ Server communication using protocols

# 🌐 DNS Resolution Flow

DNS converts domain names into IP addresses.

---

## 🔄 Steps

1. User enters domain
2. Request goes to DNS resolver
3. Resolver queries root server
4. Root → TLD server
5. TLD → Authoritative server
6. IP address returned

---

## 🧠 Example

google.com → 142.250.x.x

---

## 📌 Insight

Without DNS, you would need to remember IPs instead of domain names

# 🌐 HTTP vs HTTPS Flow

---

## 🔹 HTTP Flow

1. TCP connection
2. Request sent
3. Response received

---

## 🔹 HTTPS Flow

1. TCP connection
2. TLS handshake
3. Secure communication

---

## 🔐 TLS Handshake Includes

* Key exchange
* Encryption setup

---

## 🧠 Insight

HTTPS = HTTP + Security


# 🔄 TCP Connection Flow

---

## 📡 3-Way Handshake

1. SYN → Client
2. SYN-ACK → Server
3. ACK → Client

---

## 📦 Data Transfer

* Reliable communication
* Ordered packets

---

## 🔚 Connection Close

* FIN → ACK sequence

---

## 🧠 Insight

TCP ensures:
✔ Reliability
✔ Order
✔ Error checking

# 🔁 Full Request Lifecycle

This combines everything:

---

## 🔄 Flow

1. User enters URL
2. DNS resolves IP
3. TCP connection
4. TLS (if HTTPS)
5. HTTP request
6. Server processes
7. Response sent
8. Browser renders

---

## 🧠 Big Picture

Multiple protocols work together:

* DNS
* TCP
* TLS
* HTTP
